None,"The  information required to deliver these interest-based advertisements  will be stored by Third Party Ad Solutions alongside your IP address  and/or a cookie ID , so that you can be served the adverts without the  Third Party Ad Solutions needing to store any information that would  enable you to be identified in the offline world , like your name or  address ."
None,Adverts you might see whilst on non-Skyscanner platforms
None,You might also see adverts for our services once you 've left Skyscanner and are using non-Skyscanner websites .

None,"Similar  to the adverts you see whilst using Skyscanner , these adverts may be  personalised and served to you because of information that Third Party  Ad Solutions have collected about you , either when you were using our  services or when you were using other non-Skyscanner Platforms ."
None,"For  example , if you have searched for a flight from Edinburgh to London on  Skyscanner or another non-Skyscanner Platform , and we have asked Third  Party Ad Solution to show our advert to individuals that have expressed  an interest in travelling to London , the Third Party Ad Solution may  categorise you within that group and serve you our advert ."
